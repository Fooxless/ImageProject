# MashFoodie Web App [2022]
The purpose of this cloud application is to allow an individual to generate a random image then download it in a variety of formats depending on how they would like to use it. Currently the different support formats are HD, HDV, 2k and 4k. The idea here, is that they donâ€™t have to explicitly specify a single format, they can download the HD and 4k versions if they wish. In addition to generating and downloading a random image, a user is also able to go back through the global history and retrieve a recent previously downloaded image if it appears within the last 10 images generated.

This cloud application was also set to scale depending on a load balancer managing a small cluster of ec2 instances. The load was generated from the image transformations of the random unsplash image to the differing resolutions. The architecture was created to support this scaling.
